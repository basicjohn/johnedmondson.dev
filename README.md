## Project Notes & Ideas

#### Section: Introduction / About Me

Small 'hello' section that I can use to introduce myself and give a brief overview of my skills and experience.

#### Section: App Showcase

Show tease with a "Coming soon..." ghosted image for the other apps.

#### Section: Portfolio / Code Samples

Since most of the work that I've done is private then show some code samples from my personal projects and some obscured code from my work projects.

#### Section: Contact / Social Media

Contact form for emailing the website owner. Also, links to my social media accounts. (Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

#### Future Feature Ideas

- Add a dark mode toggle
