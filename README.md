# John Edmondson's Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's a single page application that I built using React and TypeScript. I'm using MaterialUI and Sass for styling and AWS for hosting.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Sass

**Server:** Currently hosted on AWS at [johnedmondson.dev](https://johnedmondson.dev).

## Run Locally

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/basicjohn/johnedmondson.dev.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd johnedmondson.dev
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

## Project Notes & Ideas

#### Section: Introduction / About Me

Small 'hello' section that I can use to introduce myself and give a brief overview of my skills and experience.

#### Section: App Showcase

Show tease with a "Coming soon..." ghosted image for the other apps.

#### Section: Portfolio / Code Samples

Since most of the work that I've done is private then show some code samples from my personal projects and some obscured code from my work projects.

#### Section: Blog

A blog for publishing articles about new development skills I'm gathering. This section is not to gain clout or anything like that, but to help me learn and solidify my knowledge of the topics I'm writing about.

#### Section: Contact / Social Media

Contact form for sending me an email. Also, links to my social media accounts. (Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

#### Other Feature Ideas

- Add a dark mode toggle
- Add a loading screen
- Add a 404 page
- Add a "Back to top" button
- Add a "Scroll to section" button
- Add a "View on GitHub" button
- Add a "View on CodePen" button
- Randomize on reload the font colors and font family for each section
